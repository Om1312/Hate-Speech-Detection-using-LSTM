# Hate-Speech-Detection-using-LSTM

🚀 Project Overview

This project focuses on building a Hate Speech Detection system using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) — a type of recurrent neural network widely used for text classification tasks in NLP.

The model classifies a given text/tweet into categories such as:

Hate Speech

Offensive

Neutral / Normal Speech

The dataset is preprocessed using NLP techniques and trained on an LSTM-based deep learning model.

🧠 Features

Cleans and preprocesses raw text

Tokenization & Padding

Converts words to sequences

Embedding layer for vector representation

LSTM model for context learning

Multi-class classification

Model training, evaluation & prediction
